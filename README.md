# Livestock-Health-Monitoring-and-Disease-Prediction-System

Project Overview

This project involves developing a Livestock Health Monitoring and Disease Prediction System. It utilizes IoT, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing to monitor health parameters in real-time, predict diseases, and suggest actionable interventions. The system aims to enhance animal welfare, reduce preventable diseases, and optimize productivity.
Dataset Description

The project requires a dataset containing information about livestock health parameters. Key features in the dataset might include:

    Animal ID: Unique identifier for each livestock.
    Temperature (Â°C): Body temperature readings.
    Heart Rate (bpm): Number of heartbeats per minute.
    Activity Levels: Motion sensor data.
    Behavioral Patterns: Grazing, resting, or other behaviors.
    Environmental Factors: Ambient temperature, humidity, etc.
    Health Records: Diagnosed diseases, symptoms, or anomalies.
    Intervention History: Medications or treatments administered.
    Outcome: Final health status (healthy, recovered, deceased).

Analysis Steps

    Database Setup:
        Create a relational database using tools like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
        Define tables for animal details, health parameters, sensor readings, and disease outcomes.

    Data Preprocessing:
        Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
        Normalize numerical features for consistent analysis.
        Encode categorical variables (e.g., disease type) if necessary.

    Writing Queries:
        Develop SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the database.
